  "content": "Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in Western art. He created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits, and self-portraits, and are characterized by bold colors and dramatic, impulsive, and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. He was not commercially successful, and his suicide at 37 came after years of mental illness, depression, and poverty."
